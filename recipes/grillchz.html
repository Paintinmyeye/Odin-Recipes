        These crustless grilled cheese sandwiches are great to have stashed in the freezer for when the kids need a quick snack. 
        Easy for little hands to hold, with the cheese sealed inside and no tough crusts, theyâ€™re fun for them and convenient for you. 
        You will need a sandwich sealer for this recipe, and they are easy to find online.

        I love a good grilled cheese. I always thought they were the perfect quick and easy bite.
        They are so simple and delicious, and making them easy to grab and go on the road makes them somehow even more perfect.
