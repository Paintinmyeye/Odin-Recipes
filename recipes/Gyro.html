        Most of us don't have a vertical, rotating spit at home, 
        but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to enjoy delicious gyros whenever you want! 
        Make juicy, tender, seasoned lamb gyro meat at home with just a bread loaf pan!
    </p>

        This can be served with a side of fries, a salad, or any traditional greek side dish 
        you may have on hand. I recommend some nice hummus and some stuffed grape leaves.
